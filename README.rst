==================================
Nodes for the Microhomie Framework
==================================

For full instruction see the `Microhomie <https://github.com/microhomie/microhomie>`_ repository.

This repository has a lot of pre written nodes for Microhomie, the MicroPython implementation of the `Homie v2 <https://github.com/marvinroger/homie>`_ convention.

Most of these nodes can be used out of the box to publish data.

Install nodes with upip:

>>> import upip
>>> upip.install('microhomie-node-dht22')
